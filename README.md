### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a passionate [programming motherfucker](http://programming-motherfucker.com), specialised on Internet full-stack and dev-sec-ops. I love blockchain, web 3, micro-services architectures, single-page applications, mobile apps, continuous delivery, IoT, games development, and ... everything else! 

I created long long time ago (more than 15 years ago) my own framework for rapid web development of PHP applications (https://github.com/antonioparraga/phal) porting most of the patterns from other non-PHP frameworks such as Spring-style Dependency Injection and Webflows. I also love IoT and I have submitted a few contribs to Home Assistant Project (https://home-assistant.io). I also cofounded and collaborated actively on Open Coronavirus project (https://github.com/open-coronavirus/open-coronavirus), a contact tracing app for iOS and Android.
